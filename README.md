MK-VIMRC
========

This is my beloved .vimrc. I am not an experienced programmer, 
but I fell in love with vim. 

In order to use it, you have to have [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) installed. 

This vimrc was *highly influenced* by [spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim):
https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim
I wanted to understand the vimrc I am using, so I used spf13-vimrc as a template,
though mine is not that sophisticated, but simpler. 



# Installation:

- Install [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)
- Download with 'git clone https://github.com/AAAnsie/MK-VIMRC.git'
- take the .vimrc file and use it instead of yours (don't forget to backup!)


I would love to get some feedback =)
