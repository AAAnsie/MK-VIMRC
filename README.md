MK-VIMRC
========

This is my beloved .vimrc. I am not an experienced programmer, 
but I fell in love with vim. 

In order to use it, you have to have "vundle" installed.

This vimrc was highly influenced by spf13-vim:

Installation:

- Install Vundle
- Download with 'git clone https://github.com/AAAnsie/MK-VIMRC.git'
- take the .vimrc file and use it instead of yours (don't forget to backup!)


I would love to get some feedback =)
